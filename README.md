## Description
This Landing Page serves as the second project in the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program through Udacity.com. This project serves as a chance to demonstrate our understanding of: 

1. How to append and manipulate items in the DOM
2. How to use JavaScript to enhance the usability of a site

The starter code for this project was provided by Udacity and was available for download at the following repo: 
<https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page>.
Other references for code structure are cited at the beginning of the app.js file. 

We were tasked with building upon this framework to create a multi-sectioned landing page that dynamically reacts with user viewing and newly updated material. 


## Features
According to the project instructions and rubric, the Landing Page should be able to satisfy all of the following:

1. Have a responsive layout that is usable across modern devices.
2. Have a Navigation bar that builds dynamically as sections are changed.
3. Make it clear which section the user is viewing.
4. Clicking an item on the Navbar will smoothly scroll to that section

Additional features were also in the requirements, such as styling and HTML structure, but these requirements were satisfied through the starter code.


## Dependencies
The goal of this project is to have flexibility with modern browsers, so any current browser should suffice. In order to get the project to run effectively, it is best to download it to your device. You can do this either by cloning this Repository or downloading it as a ZIP. Once the ZIP is downloaded, extract the files from it and run index.html in your browser.


## Usage
This project should be browser-ready for most modern browsers. 


## Legal
The project, starter code, and concept all come from Udacity.com. The rest of the code, and minor modifications to the starter frameworks, are my own work.
